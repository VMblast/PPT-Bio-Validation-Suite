# PPT-Bio-Validation-Suite
Numerical simulations and hydrostatic solvers for DNA geometric restoration based on Plasma Pressure Theory (PPT) 3.0.

# PPT-Bio: DNA Hydrostatic Validation Suite (v1.0.0)

This repository contains a collection of Python-based numerical solvers and simulations supporting the biological applications of **Plasma Pressure Theory (PPT) 3.0**. These scripts demonstrate the transition from quantum probability to deterministic fluid dynamics in the context of molecular biology and carcinogenesis.

## 🔬 Scientific Overview
In the PPT 3.0 framework, DNA hydrogen bonds are modeled as **hydrostatic pinning locks**. Carcinogenesis is reframed as **Geometric Drift**—a mechanical misalignment of the bond lattice caused by acoustic fatigue or external pressure variances. These scripts provide the mathematical proof that targeted Terahertz resonance can restore the hydrostatic equilibrium of the DNA structure.
